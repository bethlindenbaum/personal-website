            <p>
              I am a student at Duke University, double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Computer Science.  I enjoy working with software and hardware, and am interested in gaining experience in electronics and computers.<br><br>

              Throughout my time at Duke, I have been working on a project with a team of classmates, developing an Audio-visual Alert system for drone delivery.  We utilized technical concepts such as Arduino, circuit design, and power efficiency to develop our prototype.  Last Spring, our client invited us to present our device at a health conference in Seattle, and we are in the process of obtaining patent protection.  I have also worked on other coding projects, such as a cache simulator, a file compression/decompression program, a calculator app for iPhone, and a machine learning project meant to recommend songs on Spotify using a personalized algorithm.<br><br>

              Outside the classroom, I am very involved on Duke's campus.  I am on the executive board of Women's Club Basketball and Jewish Student Union at Duke.  I am also involved in the Society of Women Engineers and Duke Technology Scholars (DTech).  Finally, during the Spring 2025 semester, I will be a teaching assistant for Duke's Computer Architecture (COMPSCI 250) course.<br><br>

              More information about my projects, experience, and qualifications can be found on my resume, Github, and Linkedin.
