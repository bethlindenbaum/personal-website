            <p>
              I am currently a student at Duke University, double majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Computer Science.  I have technical experience in hardware, firmware, software, machine learning, and microelectronics, with proficiency in C/C++, Python, Java, and Verilog.  I find great interest in the interworkings of electrics and computers, and love to work at all levels of the technology stack, from semiconductor materials to high-level programming.<br><br>

              I sharpened my skills in firmware and embedded system design through my internship as an Embedded Linux Software Engineering Intern at Schneider Electric, where I programmed an automated test suite in C++ on an ESP32 microcontroller, implementing wireless communication protocols such as Bluetooth and Zigbee.  Additionally, I've deepened my practical skills in computer architecture and digital system design through projects such as an arcade-ready Pac-Man game on FPGA, where I used Verilog, MIPS assembly, and a custom-designed processor.  I've further honed my computer architecture, C-coding, and data structures and algorithms skills through my experience as a TA for Duke's Computer Architecture Course, and through a Cache Simulator project, written in Java.<br><br>

              <!-- Throughout my time at Duke, I have been working on a project with a team of classmates, developing an Audio-visual Alert system for drone delivery.  We utilized technical concepts such as Arduino, circuit design, and power efficiency to develop our prototype.  Last Spring, our client invited us to present our device at a health conference in Seattle, and we are in the process of obtaining patent protection.  I have also worked on other coding projects, such as a cache simulator, a file compression/decompression program, a calculator app for iPhone, and a machine learning project meant to recommend songs on Spotify using a personalized algorithm.<br><br> -->

              Outside the classroom, I am very involved on Duke's campus.  I am on the executive board of the Women's Club Basketball team and the Jewish Student Union at Duke.  I am also involved in the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Duke Technology Scholars (DTech), and Women in Technology.  Finally, as of the Spring 2026 semester, I am working in the Franklin Group Lab at Duke, which focuses on uncovering breakthroughs in nanomaterials and nanoelectronics.<br><br>

              More information about my projects, experience, and qualifications can be found on my resume, Github, and Linkedin.
